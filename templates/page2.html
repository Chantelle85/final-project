                    <p>TikTok is derived from Musical.ly, an app where people lip-synched to audio clips and shared the videos with their friends. Essentially, it's a video-based platform that allows you to create the content directly within the app or upload from your smartphone. So, why should you care about TikTok? How about one billion installs! That's a lot of people using the app.</p>

                    <p>But beyond a scrolling video feed, there aren't too many comparisons. Whereas Vine hinged on the concept of incredibly short, six-second videos, TikTok is more free-form. With that freedom comes a variety of formats and memes that have sprung up on the platform â€” from quick sketches to DIY photography tutorials. As more and more users flock to the app, more brands are joining also, trying to market on this game-changing platform.</p>

                    <p>This is the homepage of the app. The For You page is where TikTok presents a curated list of videos for you to watch, based on your previous activity. Once TikTok gets a sense of the type of videos you like, its algorithm will serve up recommended videos (by grouping together related videos) for each user. The For You page is your first starting place on TikTok, but like any platform, dive a little deeper and you'll find thriving communities built around niche interests.</p>
